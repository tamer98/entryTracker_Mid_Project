## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a simple 2-tier Python application called EntryTracker, which integrates:

- Docker containerization
- AWS ECR and EC2 for cloud deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
- The pipeline includes application packaging, testing, publishing to AWS ECR, and deployment to an EC2 production instance.

## Key Features
- REST API-based application built with Python (Flask)
- 2-tier architecture using Docker Compose (App + MySQL)
- Containerization and image management via Docker & AWS ECR
- Automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- End-to-End (E2E) testing integrated into the CI workflow
- Continuous Deployment to AWS EC2 with Docker Compose
- Version-controlled Docker image tagging within CI pipeline
